====

This online course is a collection of lessons and hands-on exercises that teach you how to write Cypher code to create nodes and relationships for an existing data model.
Then you will learn how to write Cypher code to evolve the graph as the application questions change and also as the graph data model changes.

== Prerequisites

You must have Cypher programming experience to take this course.

== Duration

If you perform all of the hands-on exercises in this course,
it will take you four hours to complete the course.

== What you will learn

* Implement a simple graph data model.
* Import data into the database for a graph data model.
* Profile queries to understand the performance characteristics of a query.
* Refactor the graph as the model changes to suit new requirements.
